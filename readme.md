# Background

Every year, the DC Courts, the DC Bar Pro Bono Program, and the DC Access to Justice Commission recognizes attorneys who provide 50 or more hours of pro bono services (or 100 or more hours of service for a higher recognition category) through the [Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll program](http://www.dcaccesstojustice.org/pro-bono-honor-roll).

mitzvotech will be building a way for attorneys and law firms to easily register for the Honor Roll program, a way to manage the data, and an attractive public front-end.
